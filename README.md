# Duos-and-Donts
This is a 2-player co-operative serious game meant to be used as a tool in couples therapy. The gameplay dynamics are designed to foster interpersonal and relational skills between players. This game is a proof-of-concept and not a deployable clinical tool.

Duos and Don'ts was built using pygame and python. This game will be hosted on game websites in the future for easier access. Until then, please follow the instructions below to run it locally. If you cannot view the game locally, you can download the HTML file and run it in your browser (though this only shows a demo of the game).

Install the pygame library using:
```pip install pygame
```
